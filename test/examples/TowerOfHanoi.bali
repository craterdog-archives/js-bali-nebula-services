    $description: "
        This class encapsulates a /Tower of Hanoi/ game with three pegs (A, B, and C) and a
        parameterized number of disks. To play the game do the following:
         # Initialize a game with 3 disks.
        `$game := [:]($type: TowerOfHanoi, $disks: 3)`
         # Play the game.
        `game.play()`
        
        The output should be:
        `
         1. Move top disk on peg A to peg C
         2. Move top disk on peg A to peg B
         3. Move top disk on peg C to peg B
         4. Move top disk on peg A to peg C
         5. Move top disk on peg B to peg A
         6. Move top disk on peg B to peg C
         7. Move top disk on peg A to peg C
